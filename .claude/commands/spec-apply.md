Read the spec file at `specs/$ARGUMENTS.md` and implement the business logic described in it.

Follow these steps:

1. Read the spec file carefully and understand all requirements
2. Identify which files need to be created or modified
3. Implement the functionality as described in the spec
4. Ensure the implementation follows existing code patterns in this codebase
5. Test the implementation if applicable

If the spec file doesn't exist, inform the user and list available specs in the `specs/` directory.
